# Pley.xyz - just a few sheets of paper

[Pely.xyz](https://www.pely.xyz/)

## Idea 
The idea when creating the solution was to create a minimalist vector drawing program woring in web browser (soon as an application for tablet and computer)

## Features
### - page size
The proportions of the drawing sheet are fixed - it is a4, which allows you to easily print notes.
### - drawing
Simple vector drawing in 3 colors and 3 pen sizes.
### - erasing
Simple erasing in 3 eraser sizes.
### - undo 
cmd + z (control + z) shortcuts work on the board. Each card has its own change history - undo works separately for each card.
### - download 
a PDF file is returned, vector graphics ensure no loss of quality regardless of the resolution of the user's monitor. 


## Available React Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
